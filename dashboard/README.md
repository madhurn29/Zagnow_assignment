# Dashboard app

This app has three section : Reports, Workspace and Settings
All though as per the problem statement only workspaces is functional.

Workspaces has all the information about the confirmed orders.
It has a table to display the data.
The data can be filtered out based on Order status and can be sort based on amount. Both the functionalities work together seemlessly.
We can also edit the Title of the order. We have a pop to edit the title of required product.
